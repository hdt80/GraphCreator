# debug
#   If true, will output debug messages relating to name tags.
#   Don't use unless asked, or bored.
#
# asyncTickCheckPeriod
#   Measured in milliseconds, this value determines how long TagAPI waits on the main thread from an asynchronous thread.
#   Normally, this isn't even needed, but some plugins and server mods queue packets from other threads.
#   Default value is 5. 
#   If you have actually done CPU profiling and know that it's still an issue, try a higher value.
#   Max value is 50, since that's the length of a 20tps tick.
